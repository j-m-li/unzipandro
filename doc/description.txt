Description
-----------

UnzipAndro was created because of the need for a free and easy to use "unzip" utility.

There are other applications of this type available on the store, but our application is ad-free and its Java/C source code is freely available.

It was developed as part of the PDOS (Public Domain Operating System) project by a global team of developers.
