Extract the .zip files located in your Download directory.


Description
-----------

UnzipAndro has been created due to the need for a free and easy to use "unzip"
utility.

There are other applications of this kind available on the store, but our app is
ad-free and its Java / C source code is available for free.

It was developed in the context of the PDOS (Public Domain Operating System)
project by a worldwide team of developers.
